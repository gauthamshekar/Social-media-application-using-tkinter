# Social-media-application-using-tkinter
Creating a social application using python. Python has a very strong GUI library named Tkinter. With that module I am developing the social media application. Still I have to learn how the frames work in tkinter. When I start designing the app.py it was similar like designing a webpage using html and CSS.

I have attached the app.py which have the code any one can tell me how to create the multiple frame starting from the login page and register page.

I have still need to do some changes in the application and I need to learn a lot from the Tkinter module.

Right now I have finished the start page and the output of the start page is below or you can see it in the output.jpg.
Iam still working on this project.
